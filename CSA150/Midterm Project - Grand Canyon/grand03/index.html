        <h1>About the Grand Canyon</h1>
        <p>It's not the largest canyon in the world, but it's probably the most well-known. Grand Canyon National Park sees almost 4 million visitors each year, from all over the world. Most of these admire the Canyon from the top or a short hike below the rim. Less than 1% of those visitors, about 40,000 people, camp one or more nights below the rim each year.</p>
        <p><b>The Grand Canyon</b> is located in northern Arizona. It's 277 miles long, 18 miles wide at the widest point, and over a mile deep in places. It took millions of years of erosion to create it, and it's getting wider and deeper every day.</p>
